    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of its input. Analyzing time complexity helps in selecting the most <strong>efficient</strong> algorithms for a given problem. Understanding time complexity is crucial for optimizing performance in software development.

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the total amount of memory or space required by an algorithm as a function of the input size. It helps in determining how scalable an algorithm is when dealing with large datasets. A common example is O(n), where the memory needed grows linearly with the input size.
